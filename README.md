# This repo is all about to use raw query in laravel instead eloquent ORM and a incomplete artist management with a dashboard where you can upload musics.
I created becauseof a interviewer tell me to use raw query instead eloquent in laravel and build a site to manage musics for artists. So i spend time around 2 to 3 hours, just for a showcase.
